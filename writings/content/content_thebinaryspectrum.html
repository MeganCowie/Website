<p>Injustice and human suffering are threads that wind back through every avenue of human history. Today, thankfully, we are in an place and time where we can voice our objections to societal “wrongs”. On the progressive side, there is a constant grumbling din that is highlighted by moments of uproar: For women in 2017, for the climate in 2019, and for people of colour, particularly Black Americans, in 2020. I identify as a progressive and an idealist, and I tend to sympathize with the issues adopted by my peers. But I frequently find myself questioning the methods by which we, progressives, are attempting to create change. Waves of uproar may give a cause momentum, and sometimes leave tangible change in their wake. But it seems to me that when the waves become tsunamis, non-nuanced and all-powerful, they can actually sweep us further away from our collective goals. In the aftermath, do we find a stronger society or a weakened one?</p>

<h2>The Righteous Activist</h2>
<p>What is the purpose, that is, what is the motivation and intended result, of our various modern forms of progressive activism? Social media discourse is the latest mode of activism. What is the motivation for changing a profile picture or sharing a link? Is it to inform the world that we are not racist, not sexist, etc.? Is it to educate our peers? Is it to broadcast our ideology? What tangible change do these actions create? Progressive activism is also often characterized by protests. What is the purpose of protest, nowadays? Is it to educate the people who attend? This is undeniably a positive consequence. But is this really the best means for change? In 2019, hundreds of thousands of people marched past my window “for the climate”. What was the consequence of this? This perplexes me all the more because we already know steps individuals can take to create tangible change for the climate. Montreal would have been instantly transformed if all of those hundreds of thousands had, for example, quietly become vegan rather than marched, or if they had committed to a reduced-waste lifestyle. But did this protest accomplish any change on the individual level, let alone to legislature or society at large?</p>
<br>
<p>Protests have become a symptom of unrest rather than a means for change. This in itself is fine. I cannot criticize the people who protest because they are angry. They have been dealt injustice and they need the world to know it. This is an emotional response. This is fair. The unintended and detrimental consequence of protest and social media discourse is that they satisfy the righteous activist. How many pat themselves on the back and return to life as usual within a week or two, without actually contributing to real, tangible change? These are good people, mind, with good intentions, and in some cases, they have feelings of desperation to create change. But they are pacified by the feeling that they have “done the right thing”, even though that “right thing” accomplished nothing at all.</p>
<br>
<h2>Screams in an Echo Chamber</h2>
<p>And furthermore: who are we talking to, when we partake in these various modern forms of progressive activism? Who are we yelling at when we march down the street? Who are we sharing articles for on social media? We are surrounded by people similar to ourselves. The articles we share are seen by people who mostly share our ideology. We are screaming into an echo chamber of people who think just like us. This echo chamber hums with perpetual unsettledness. This has always been the case, only modern tools have allowed us to polish our echo chamber so that it now amplifies even the tiniest voices. Before the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020, sparked by the death of George Floyd and catalyzed by the racial disparity of the health and economic consequences of COVID-19, the background din was already there. Who in my circle did not know that there occur many instances of police brutality and racial profiling? Who in my circle did not know that systemic racism remains a problem in society? But at the peak of Summer 2020, everyone was screaming. Collective voices were reverberating off of the walls, sounding very loud and very powerful. But eventually people stop screaming, the energy dissipates, and the sound reverts to a background grumble.</p>
<br>
<h2>Our Battle Cries</h2>
<p>Communicating the extent of an issue or a proposed solution is challenging. Firstly, our echo chamber tends to lose nuance. The more subtle components of an idea are lost as it bounces through the mainstream. Secondly, media and social media sensationalize. Extreme statements and horrifying anecdotes set the emotions of even the most logical individuals ablaze. Our battle cries therefore tend to become aggressive, hashtaggable slogans: “Kill all men!”, “Defund the police!”, which almost never mean what the words themselves literally indicate. If “kill all men” is not at all what feminism means, why do we say it? The debate then becomes about mere semantics: “antifeminism” and “All Lives Matter” become the easy attacks of the offended.</p>
<br>
<h2>Widening the Ideological Canyon</h2>
<p>The “you’re either with us or against us” mentality is powerful. It forces people to take a position, and this can work either for a cause or against it. One effect is that it causes people to evaluate themselves: to “check their privilege”, to learn more about the issue. These results are positive and are, I think, the intended consequence of this approach. But the danger in the “with or against us” mentality is that it makes the spectrum a binary. Ethical issues are complicated, and there is always a grey area on each side of right and wrong. (I have yet to see a philosopher provide a convincing defense of objective ethics.) Yet there seems to be an uptick in the vilification of people who have any opinion that is not the one held by the mainstream. It seems to me that this is because, amidst the glorification of herd mentality, the mainstream lays claim to objective morality. And moreover: at every instant there are infinite injustices in the world, but the “trending” issue is deemed the important one, the urgent one. The herd claimed that “silence is violence” regarding racial injustice. What about silence over sweatshops or wars overseas? Not only are people who do not hold the precise position of the mainstream vilified; if they are truly “progressive”, they must hold and voice that position at exactly the moment when it is popular.</p>
<br>
<h2>Bridging the Abyss</h2>
<p>There is harm, say some, in over-intellectualizing these issues. To be able to step back out of the emotional turmoil of a societal ‘wrong’ is undoubtedly a privilege. But I do not think this type of logical evaluation is harmful. Rather I believe that it should be our way forward. Something must be done, we agree, but simple solutions such as a social media post or a march down the street cannot possibly be hoped to counter the stunning complexity of the issues we face. There are more colours than red and blue. There is purple, and room – no, necessity – for nuance and discourse.</p>
