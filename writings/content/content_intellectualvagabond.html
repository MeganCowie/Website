<p>"If you could have any superpower, what superpower would you choose?" Remember that question, mostly from childhood? It seems to still pop up from time to time. By 'superpower', we tend to simply mean 'you can do anything'. If we try harder to hone in on a definition, we might say that a 'superpower' is some ability to break or twist the laws of nature. The same goes for 'magic': What is magic, except some ability to operate outside of natural law?</p><br>

<p>But for every superhero comic, there is a scifi novel. For every superpower we daydream -- the ability to fly, to time travel, to teleport, to be invisible, to read minds -- we  hypothesize some natural counterpart, some feat of engineering centuries ahead of our time. In scifi, we find time-travelling intergalactic civilizations, invisibility shields which conceal entire spaceships, and brain-computer interfaces which allow people to read each other's minds. Famously put by one of the world's most legendary scifi authors, "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." - Arthur C. Clarke.</p><br>

<p>The technology of today was once inconceivable. The world we live in, then, in some sense is a magical one, and we are all magicians as we wander through the here and now. Every bridge we step on, every word we type, every light we turn on, is a marvel.</p><br>
    
<p>Our examination of technology cannot stop there. More astounding, even, than the feats of engineering that surround us, is that we ourselves -- these bodies, these jumbled collections of molecules -- can think and learn and observe the world. We ourselves are a technological wonder that is centuries ahead of the engineering of our time. Every thought that rattles around our conscious minds is indistinguishable from magic. Just look at the simple complexity of our existence. We are all superheroes.</p>

<p>I feel an immense thrill that I have the opportunity to explore this technological wonder of existence. I like stretching this muscle of learning new things, of coming upon new ideas, new instruments of engineering, new outlets for creativity, of being an eternal student without a curriculum. Some people dive deeply into singular hobbies and passions, and I admire their dedication and the competence that comes from practice. I've always been more of an intellectual vagabond, wandering happily from project to project, from idea to idea, deriving most joy from the journey itself.</p><br>

<p>When a kid pokes around outdoors and finds an interesting rock somewhere, their first inclination, after taking a moment to examine the rock themselves, is to run up to whoever they're with and excitedly say "Look, look, at what I found!" I guess that's my motivation in building this website: It's a place to point to and say "Look, look, at this cool thing!" It's fun to come upon new ideas; it's also fun to debate them. It's fun to build new things; it's also fun to see what other creatives build. It's fun to be a student; it's also fun to teach and share.</p><br>

<p>I have been, in the more conventional sense, a real-life student and teacher for a long time. In 2023, I completed my Ph.D. in experimental condensed matter physics at McGill University. I helped develop and coordinate the first-year physics lab courses at McGill, and off-and-on, because I love teaching, I tutor highschool and undergraduate math and physics. Now I am a professional scientist in a research lab, working on some pretty fundamental technology and surrounded by some of the most brilliant and creative people I have ever met. I feel very privileged that in my work, my day-to-day, I get to learn, discover, and explore.</p>
