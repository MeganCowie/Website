<p>In 2020, I put 100 hours into Chopin's Fantasie Impromptu. This progress video was a Christmas gift to my parents. The song is way above my level but it's so gorgeous I couldn't help giving it a try. It's still riddled with things that need to be improved/fixed, but my 100-hour progress mark is at 19:15 (I imagine the first half of the video is only interesting to you if you're: a- my parent; or b- learning this piece...) </p>

<p>Here's to a 2021 with slightly less time to play the piano.</p>
