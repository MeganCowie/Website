<p>Every coordinate on the ideological spectrum has two types of players: Actors and Philosophers. The Actors want to build things, to create tangible change. Engineers build bridges, but they could never do so if they chased a perfect understanding, past the quantum scale, of the material properties of the bridge. So similarly are Actors required to disregard nuance to some degree, for the purpose of getting things done. Philosophers have the goal of understanding nuanced issues as thoroughly as possible. But it's less common to see scientists building things than engineers, because the motivation is not 'practicality' but knowledge, completeness, and consistency. So similarly Philosophers chase many nuances without knowing whether they are relevant for immediate tangible change.</p>
<br>
<p>Both players have advantages and flaws. There's something powerful, something necessary, in acting that the Philosophers cannot accomplish. We have seen this in the countless historical cases where people “took a stand” for the sake of “progress”. Gay rights, women's rights, black rights, etc. Ultimately, is there a rigorous defense for all of these? Isn't is possible that any of these issues could still just be circulating around discussion tables instead of brought to tangibility by someone saying: “Here is my belief, I think it is right, there's no need for more discussion, I need to act now.” And yet, as a friend of mine was quick to respond to me, action undertaken too quickly historically also has consequences. After all, it was Marx who said: “Philosophers have only interpreted the world; the point is to change it.” Sometimes the Actors will be wrong, or premature, or unknowingly sacrificing too much nuance, which can lead to devastating unforeseen consequences. Conversely, the Philosopher runs no danger of undertaking any action prematurely, yet risks not accomplishing anything at all.</p>
<br>
<p>Just like there's a benefit to having both progressivism and conservatism in any society, we also need a healthy balance of Actors and Philosophers at every coordinate on the ideological spectrum. Philosophers should not think of Actors as enemies, even if we think they put their engineering hats on too soon, because without them we'd never get anything done. And similarly, Actors should not villainize Philosophers. We are ideological peers, and should not be cancelled or banished for posing questions that challenge the mainstream gospel.</p>
<br>
<p>Right now, at least on the progressive side of the ideological spectrum, it seems to me that the Actors are drowning out the Philosophers. I wonder if this is because it's seen as admirable to be an Actor, so much so that the Philosophers are made to feel unprogressive due to our methodology. We are pushed to private, hushed conversations with trusted confidantes to timidly whisper: "Well now, I don't know about this... Well now, I'm not so sure... I think I need to give this a bit more thought..." There is validity to the Actors' argument that Philosophers are in a privileged position of abstraction. It does seem likely that the reason most Philosophers are able to philosophize is that the issue in question does not impact them directly, at least, not in a personally devastating way. And yet, we Philosophers play a critical role in challenging the Actors by pushing them toward self-consistency, which is a much sturdier foundation for the society that all of the different players of progressivism concorantly want to build.</p>
